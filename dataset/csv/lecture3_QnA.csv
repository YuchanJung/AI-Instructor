How can domain knowledge impact the effectiveness of machine learning models?,Domain knowledge can provide unique insights and specialized data that improve the model's relevance and performance in specific tasks.
What is a potential downside of using a large neural network on an edge device?,"Large neural networks can be too computationally intensive for low-power edge devices, which may not handle the complexity efficiently."
What is a common initial approach to deploying a simple VAD system?,A common initial approach is to measure if the audio volume exceeds a certain threshold to detect if someone is speaking.
How can a simple heuristic approach benefit machine learning deployment?,"Simple heuristics can be easier to implement, debug, and maintain, and may generalize better in varying real-world conditions."
Why should machine learning teams revisit their models periodically after deployment?,"Revisiting models is necessary because real-world data may change, requiring updates or retraining to maintain performance."
