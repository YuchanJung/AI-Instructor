What data augmentation methods can be used for medical imaging datasets?,"Rotation, zoom, blur, translation, and adding noise."
In what case might data augmentation hurt the performance of a model?,"In character recognition, augmentation like flipping can result in mislabeling similar characters such as 'b' and 'd'."
What is the relationship between nx and ny for an RGB image input and a segmentation mask output?,"nx = 3 * ny, where nx is for the RGB image and ny is for the segmentation mask."
What is the importance of using the binary cross-entropy loss in segmentation tasks?,"It measures the loss for each pixel, ensuring the model accurately categorizes each part of the image."
"When using transfer learning, what are the critical hyperparameters to tune?","The number of pre-trained layers (L), the number of new layers added (L_0), and the number of layers to freeze (L_f)."
What is the advantage of using bounding boxes over segmentation?,Bounding boxes are faster and easier to compute but less precise compared to segmentation.
How can you modify a dataset to better define cell boundaries in segmentation tasks?,"Label each pixel as cell, no cell, or boundary using softmax activation and adjust the loss function to penalize boundary misclassification."
How can gradients help in explaining a model's prediction in a classification task?,"By calculating the derivative of the output with respect to the input, showing which input pixels most influence the output."
Can a model trained on doctor-labeled data outperform the doctors? Explain.,"Yes, if the dataset was labeled by a committee of doctors, the model can average out individual errors, potentially outperforming a single doctor."
What is the importance of external validation for a machine learning model?,It tests the model's generalizability and performance on data from different sources or distributions.
What is one potential pitfall of automation bias in healthcare AI models?,"Experts might start relying too much on the model's decisions, potentially ignoring critical aspects of patient care."
