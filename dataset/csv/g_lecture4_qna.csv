Question,Answer
What is the main topic of this lecture?,Advanced models for computer vision.
Why do we need to go beyond classification?,Classification captures sparse image details.
What percentage of information do we get visually?,80% of information comes from the eyes.
What is object detection?,Identifying object class and location in an image.
What is the Holy Grail of computer vision?,Achieving human-level scene understanding.
What is pose estimation?,Detecting key points to understand object positions.
What is instance segmentation?,Distinguishing individual objects within the same class.
Why is bounding box detection insufficient?,It lacks precision for non-rectangular objects.
What is RetinaNet?,A one-stage object detector with focal loss.
What is Faster R-CNN?,A two-stage object detector using region proposals.
What is the key difference between one-stage and two-stage detectors?,One-stage integrates classification and regression.
What is hard negative mining?,Training with hard-to-classify negative examples.
What is focal loss?,Loss function to focus on hard examples.
What is semantic segmentation?,Labeling every pixel of an image with a class.
What is U-Net?,A model for medical image segmentation using skip connections.
What is pooling in ConvNets?,Reducing feature map resolution to increase abstraction.
What does upsampling do?,Increases resolution of feature maps.
What is optical flow?,Tracking pixel movement between frames.
Why is motion important in vision?,Motion helps distinguish objects during learning.
What is a 3D convolution?,A convolution applied over space and time in videos.
What is action recognition?,Labeling actions in a video using temporal features.
What does Kinetics dataset focus on?,It includes videos for action recognition.
What are the two streams in action recognition?,"One for object category, one for motion."
Why is transfer learning useful?,It reuses knowledge from one task for another.
What is video segmentation?,Segmenting objects in consecutive video frames.
What is self-supervised learning?,Learning without explicit labels using data structure.
What is metric learning?,Learning to measure distances between data points.
What is contrastive loss?,"Encouraging similar points to cluster, others to separate."
What is triplet loss?,Ensures positive samples are closer than negative samples.
What is the challenge of using videos?,High memory and computational cost.
