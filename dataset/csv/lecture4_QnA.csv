What is an adversarial example in the context of neural networks?,An input image slightly modified to be misclassified by the neural network.
How can the effectiveness of adversarial examples be reduced?,"By adding constraints to the optimization problem, such as ensuring modified images remain visually similar to the original."
What method is suggested to defend against adversarial examples in neural networks?,Training on adversarial examples alongside real examples or using safety nets.
What is the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM)?,A method to generate adversarial examples by applying small perturbations in the direction of the gradient of the loss function.

How do you create a non-targeted adversarial attack?,Generate an input that causes the neural network to produce an incorrect classification.
What is a targeted adversarial attack?,"Generating an adversarial example that misclassifies the input as a specific, incorrect class."
What is the purpose of the discriminator in a GAN?,"To differentiate between real and generated data, essentially acting as a binary classifier."
What is the minimax game in the context of GANs?,"A training setup where the generator tries to fool the discriminator, which attempts to identify real versus generated data."
What is the loss function for the discriminator in a GAN?,It is the binary cross-entropy loss to distinguish real data from generated data.
How does the generator in a GAN improve its performance?,By generating data that fools the discriminator into classifying it as real.

What is the Inception Score?,A metric that evaluates the quality and diversity of images generated by a GAN.
What challenge arises from high-dimensional input spaces in neural networks?,The high dimensionality makes it easier for small perturbations to significantly alter the model's output.
Why might multiple training iterations for the discriminator be beneficial in GAN training?,"To ensure the discriminator stays ahead of the generator, allowing the generator to learn from a competent discriminator."
How does batch normalization help in training GANs?,"It stabilizes and accelerates training by normalizing the inputs to each layer, reducing internal covariate shift."
What is the role of the ReLU activation function in neural networks?,To introduce non-linearity into the model while mitigating the vanishing gradient problem.
Why might a GAN generate an image of a non-realistic object?,Due to the generator learning an incorrect representation of the data distribution or insufficient training.
