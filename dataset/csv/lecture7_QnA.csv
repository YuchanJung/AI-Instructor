Question,Answer
What are some types of layers discussed in convolutional neural networks?,"Pooling, max pooling, average pooling, and convolutional layers."
Which advanced application techniques involve YOLO and R-CNN?,"Object detection with YOLO, Fast R-CNN, and Faster R-CNN."
What is the main purpose of using saliency maps in neural networks?,To understand the decision process of the network by mapping back the output decision to the input space.
How can the score for a specific class be backpropagated to the input?,By taking the derivative of the score of the class and backpropagating it to the input.
Why is it recommended to use the pre-softmax score instead of the post-softmax score for backpropagation?,To avoid minimizing scores of other classes and to focus on maximizing the correct class score.
What is occlusion sensitivity and how is it applied?,Occlusion sensitivity tests how the classification confidence changes with parts of the input image occluded by a gray square.
What information does a saliency map provide?,It shows which pixels are most influential in the network's decision-making process.
What is global average pooling and its purpose?,It averages each feature map into one number to form a vector before the classification layer.
What structural change occurs in a CNN when applying global average pooling?,Flattening the output volume to average values across each feature map.
How do class activation maps help in understanding network localization?,By showing how much each feature map contributes to the output score and up-sampling it to fit the input image size.
Why are class activation maps dependent on the class label?,"Different class labels produce different weightings of the feature maps, affecting the final visualization."
What visual information can you obtain from class model visualization using gradient ascent?,"An image that maximizes the neural network's output for a specific class, showing what the network 'sees' for that class."
What is dataset search in neural network research?,Forward propagating many images through the network to find which images highly activate a particular feature map.
How can dataset search help identify a feature map’s function?,By observing which images or parts of images most strongly activate the feature map.
What is deconvolution in the context of neural networks?,The process of up-sampling the encoded information from a smaller volume back to the size of the input image.
Why is assuming an orthogonal matrix useful in deconvolution?,It allows for using the transpose of the convolution weights as a simple approximation for deconvolution.
How can deconvolution reveal what specific activations detect?,"By reversing pooling, ReLU operations, and convolution to reconstruct the portion of the image that caused the activation."
How is unpooling approximated in neural networks?,By using switches to remember which positions had the maximum values during max pooling.
Why does global average pooling not lose spatial information as expected?,Because the feature maps are still referenced to their original positions before averaging out.
What visualization technique explains why the network makes specific predictions?,Class activation maps.
What is the purpose of Deep Dream in neural network visualizations?,"Creating enhanced input images that maximize certain activations in the network, often leading to surreal visuals."
How does ReLU function in the backward pass during backpropagation?,It passes gradients back unchanged for inputs that were positive and zeroes out gradients for inputs that were negative.
How does occlusion sensitivity visually demonstrate the network's focus?,By showing a probability map of the affected area when parts of the input image are occluded with a gray square.
Why is it important to visualize neural network activations?,To validate that the network is focusing on relevant features and to build trust in model predictions.
How can activation maximization help validate neural network predictions?,"By showing which input patterns lead to high activations for specific classes, ensuring the network learns meaningful features."
What can be inferred from consistently dark feature maps in visualization tools?,It could indicate dead neurons that are not contributing to the network’s output.
What benefit does dataset search provide to network interpretability?,"It identifies what type of input data maximally activates certain network filters, hinting at their learned features."
What kind of content do Deep Dream images produce to increase activations?,"Patterns and objects recognized by the network, leading to enhanced activation and visualization."
How is Deep Dream different from class model visualization using gradient ascent?,Deep Dream amplifies existing features in the image by setting gradients to current activations and iteratively updating the input.
